        Please note that by default better_launch will generate an anonymous node name if no node name was specified. This helps to avoid multiple nodes with the same name, which in ROS2 is both possible and problematic. If you really don't want to specify a node name, pass an empty string instead.

        This method also handles lifecycle nodes (they REALLY should have a common interface). Note that especially for lifecycle nodes you probably want `autostart_process == True`, otherwise there lifecycle management will not exist. With `autostart_process == True`, a lifecycle node will automatically advance to `lifecycle_target` once it is up. Otherwise you can also call [Node.start][better_launch.elements.abstract_node.AbstractNode.start] later.

        The `ROS2 documentation <https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/How-To-Guides/Node-arguments.html>`_ can provide some additional information regarding `params`, `remaps`, and so on.

        Parameters
        ----------
        package : str
            The package providing the node.
        executable : str
            The executable that should be run.
        name : str, optional
            The name you want the node to be known as. If `None`, a name will be derived from `package` and `executable` and `anonymous` will be set to True. Pass an empty string instead if you really want to use the node's default name - just know that you'll make a cute kitten really sad.
        remaps : dict[str, str], optional
            Tells the node to replace any topics it wants to interact with according to the provided dict.
        params : str | dict[str, Any], optional
            Any ROS parameters you want to pass to the node. These are the args you would typically have to declare in your launch file. A string will be interpreted as a path to a yaml file which will be lazy loaded using [BetterLaunch.load_params][].
        cmd_args : list[str], optional
            Additional command line arguments to pass to the node.
        env : dict[str, str], optional
            Additional environment variables to set for the node's process. The node process will merge these with the environment variables of the better_launch host process unless `isolate_env` is True.
        isolate_env : bool, optional
            If True, the node process' env will not be inherited from the parent process and only those passed via `env` will be used. Be aware that this can result in many common things to not work anymore since e.g. keys like *PATH* will be missing.
        log_level : int, optional
            The minimum severity a logged message from this node must have in order to be published. This will be added to the cmd_args unless it is None.
        output : LogSink | Iterable[LogSink] | Iterable[str] | str, optional
            Determines if and where this node's output should be directed. Common choices are `screen` to print to terminal, `log` to write to a common log file, `own_log` to write to a node-specific log file, and `none` to not write any output anywhere. See [configure_logger][utils.better_logging.configure_logger] for details.
        anonymous : bool, optional
            If True, the node name will be appended with a unique suffix to avoid name conflicts.
        hidden : bool, optional
            If True, the node name will be prepended with a "_", hiding it from common listings.
        on_exit : Callable, optional
            A function to call when the node's process terminates (after any possible respawns).
        max_respawns : int, optional
            How often to restart the node process if it terminates.
        respawn_delay : float, optional
            How long to wait before restarting the node process after it terminates.
        use_shell : bool, optional
            If True, invoke the node executable via the system shell. While this gives access to the shell's builtins, this has the downside of running the node inside a "mystery program" which is platform and user dependent. Generally not advised.
        autostart_process : bool, optional
            If True, start the node process before returning from this function.
        ros_waittime : float, optional
            How long to wait for the node to register with ROS. This should cover the time between the process starting and the node initializing itself. Set negative to wait indefinitely. Set to None to avoid the check entirely. Will do nothing if `autostart_process` is False.
        lifecycle_waittime : float, optional
            How long to wait for the node's lifecycle management to come up. This should cover the time between the node initializing itself (see `ros_waittime`) and creating its additional topics and services. While neglible on modern computers, slower devices and embedded systems may experience a noticable delay here. Set negative to wait indefinitely. Set to None to avoid the check entirely. Will do nothing if `autostart_process` is False.
        lifecycle_target : LifecycleStage | str, optional
            The lifecycle stage to bring the node into after starting. Has no effect if `autostart_process` is False or if the node does not appear to be a lifecycle node after waiting `ros_waittime + lifecycle_waittime`.
        raw : bool, optional
            If True, don't treat the executable as a ROS2 node and avoid passing it any command line arguments except those specified.
        remap_qualifier : str, optional
            Additional qualifier that will precede the node's `__ns` and `__name` remap rules. Should be the original name of the node (i.e. whatever its default name is) and can be qualified with a namespace. Useful to prevent multiple nodes with the same name when a process can have more than one node (e.g. `controller_manager`). See [this ROS2 design doc](https://design.ros2.org/articles/static_remapping.html#how-the-syntax-works) for more information.
        qualify_all_remaps : bool, optional
            If True, apply the `remap_qualifier` to all remaps that are not already qualified.

        """Creates a composer node which can be used to load [Component][]s. Components can be instantiated directly, or preferably via [component][]. Only components can reside within a composer.

        Existing composers can be reused even if they have been created outside of *better_launch*. See [Composer][] for further details.

        This method should be used as a context, e.g.

        .. code:: python

            bl = BetterLaunch()
            with bl.compose("my-composer"):
                bl.component("my_package", "mystuff:TheComponentOfDreams", "normal-component")

        Note that new nodes created by a component are using the composer's remaps. This for example applies to transform listeners (but not transform publishers). See the `related issue <https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/issues/2404>`_ in rclcpp.

        Parameters
        ----------
        name : str, optional
            The name you want the composer to be known as. `anonymous` will be set to True if no name is provided. Pass an empty string if you really want to use the composer node's default name.
        language : str, optional
            The implementation of the standard composer you want to use. Ignored if `reuse_existing` is True and a matching node is found.
        variant : Literal["normal", "multithreading", "isolated"], optional
            ROS2 provides special composers for components that need multithreading or should be isolated from the rest. Ignored if `reuse_existing` is True and a matching node is found.
        reuse_existing : bool, optional
            If True and a node matching the current namespace and provided name is found, it will be used instead of creating a new node. This will even work for composers not created through better_launch, although in that case it won't be possible to stop them.
        component_remaps : dict[str, str], optional
            Any remaps you want to apply to all *components* loaded into this composer.
        anonymous : bool, optional
            If True, the composer name will be appended with a unique suffix to avoid name conflicts. `reuse_existing` will be set to False in this case.
        hidden : bool, optional
            If True, the composer name will be prepended with a "_", hiding it from common listings.
        autostart_process : bool, optional
            If True, start the composer process before returning from this function. Note that setting this to False for a composer will make it unusable as a context object, since you won't be able to load any components.
        ros_waittime : float, optional
            How long to wait for the composer to register with ROS. This should cover the time between the process starting and the composer initializing itself. Set negative to wait indefinitely. Will do nothing if `autostart_process` is False.
        output : LogSink | Iterable[LogSink] | Iterable[str] | str, optional
            Determines if and where this node's output should be directed. Common choices are `screen` to print to terminal, `log` to write to a common log file, `own_log` to write to a node-specific log file, and `none` to not write any output anywhere. See [configure_logger][utils.better_logging.configure_logger] for details.

        If you instead want to load components without a `compose` context, you should instantiate [Component][] objects directly, then load them via [Component.start][] or [Composer.load_component][]. See the examples for more details.

        Parameters
        ----------
        package : str
            The package providing the component implementation.
        plugin : str
            The name the component is registered as, typically of the form `<package>::<Name>`.
        name : str, optional
            The name the instantiated component should be known as. If `None`, a name will be derived from `package` and `plugin`, and `anonymous` will be set to True. Pass an empty string instead if you really want to use the node's default name - just know that you'll make a cute kitten really sad.
        remaps : dict[str, str], optional
            Tells the node to replace any topics it wants to interact with according to the provided dict.
        anonymous : bool, optional
            If True, the composer name will be appended with a unique suffix to avoid name conflicts.
        hidden : bool, optional
            If True, the composer name will be prepended with a "_", hiding it from common listings.
        params : str | dict[str, Any], optional
            Any ROS parameters you want to pass to the component. These are the args you would typically have to declare in your launch file. A string will be interpreted as a path to a yaml file which will be lazy loaded using [BetterLaunch.load_params][].
        use_intra_process_comms : bool, optional
            If True, ask the composer node to enable intra-process communication, i.e. share memory between components when passing messages instead of serializing and deserializing.
        ros_waittime : float, optional
            How long to wait for the component to register with ROS. This should cover the time between the process starting and the component initializing itself. Set negative to wait indefinitely. Set to None to avoid the check entirely. Will do nothing if `autostart_process` is False.
        lifecycle_waittime : float, optional
            How long to wait for the component's lifecycle management to come up. This should cover the time between the component initializing itself (see `ros_waittime`) and creating its additional topics and services. While neglible on modern computers, slower devices and embedded systems may experience a noticable delay here. Set negative to wait indefinitely. Set to None to avoid the check entirely. Will do nothing if `autostart_process` is False.
        lifecycle_target : LifecycleStage | str, optional
            The lifecycle stage to bring the component into after starting. Has no effect if `autostart_process` is False or if the component does not appear to be a lifecycle component after waiting `ros_waittime + lifecycle_waittime`.
        output : LogSink | Iterable[LogSink] | Iterable[str] | str, optional
            Determines if and where this node's output should be directed. Common choices are `screen` to print to terminal, `log` to write to a common log file, `own_log` to write to a node-specific log file, and `none` to not write any output anywhere.

        Usually, calling [ros2_actions][] is more convenient for queueing actions. However, calling this *first* allows to prevent starting the underlying `launch.LaunchService` immediately, giving more control over when the actions are executed.

        Since the `LaunchService` insists on running on the main thread it will be started as a sub process.

        Note that only one instance of the ROS2 wrapper should ever exist. Calling this method after it has been created will return the already existing instance instead. Any passed arguments will be silently discarded.

        Parameters
        ----------
        name : str, optional
            The name used to identify the process and its logger.
        launchservice_args : list[str], optional
            Additional launch arguments to pass to the ROS2 launch service. These will end up in `launch.LaunchContext.argv`.
        output : LogSink | Iterable[LogSink] | Iterable[str] | str, optional
            How log output from the launch service should be handled. This will also include the output from all nodes launched by this launch service. Common choices are `screen` to print to terminal, `log` to write to a common log file, `own_log` to write to a node-specific log file, and `none` to not write any output anywhere. See [configure_logger][utils.better_logging.configure_logger] for details.
        start_immediately : bool, optional

        -------
        Ros2LaunchWrapper
            The wrapper hosting the ROS2 launch service process.

        This mainly exists to cover the use case where you want to interact with ROS from an `rclpy.Timer`. A synchronous call from within a timer (e.g. a service call like [Node.set_live_params][]) will block ROS' background event loop, preventing publishers, subscribers, services, etc. from doing their work. It will also prevent a clean shutdown as ROS usually waits for the event queue to become empty.

        When executing a long running task this way it is a good idea to check [is_shutdown][] in between iterations.

        Parameters
        ----------
        delay : float
            How long to wait in seconds before calling the callback.
        callback : Callable
            The function to call after the timeout. Will not be called if [shutdown][] is called beforehand.
        *args : Any, optional
